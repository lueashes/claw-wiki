# Claw Wiki

`claw-wiki` is an OpenClaw skill repository that keeps a local, searchable snapshot of the OpenClaw documentation.

It is designed for two jobs:

- Answer OpenClaw questions from checked-in docs instead of model memory
- Refresh that snapshot from the upstream OpenClaw repository in a repeatable way

The repository combines an OpenClaw skill entrypoint (`SKILL.md`), a local docs corpus (`openclaw_docs/`), and maintenance scripts for syncing, validating, indexing, and diffing updates.

## What is in this repo

- `SKILL.md`: the OpenClaw skill definition and lookup workflow
- `openclaw_docs/`: the current local OpenClaw docs snapshot
- `docs.json`: docs navigation metadata copied from upstream
- `references/`: routing, query, and update helpers used by the skill
- `scripts/`: sync and validation utilities
- `state/`: generated metadata about the current snapshot

## Typical use cases

- You want a local OpenClaw reference corpus that OpenClaw can load and cite by file path
- You want deterministic answers based on a pinned docs snapshot
- You want to check whether your local OpenClaw docs are stale
- You want to pull the latest upstream docs and generate a change summary

## Install as an OpenClaw skill

OpenClaw can load skills from your workspace `./skills` directory or from `~/.openclaw/skills`. Clone or copy this repo into one of those locations and keep the folder name as `claw-wiki`.

Example:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lueashes/claw-wiki.git
cp -R claw-wiki ~/.openclaw/skills/claw-wiki
```

Workspace-local installation is also valid:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lueashes/claw-wiki.git ./skills/claw-wiki
```

After that, OpenClaw can load the skill when the task is clearly about OpenClaw docs lookup or docs refresh.

## How the skill works

The skill answers questions from local files under `openclaw_docs/`, then cites exact paths used to produce the answer.

The normal lookup flow is:

1. Route the question to likely docs areas with `references/routing-cheatsheet.md`
2. Narrow candidates with `rg --files` or `rg -n`
3. Read the top relevant docs files in full
4. Answer with explicit file-path citations

For freshness-sensitive questions, the skill also reads:

- `state/source-lock.json` for the upstream source, ref, commit, and sync timestamp
- `state/latest-diff.md` for the last snapshot diff summary

## Refresh the OpenClaw docs snapshot

This repo is meant to mirror the upstream OpenClaw docs into `openclaw_docs/`.

### Option 1: Sync from a local OpenClaw checkout

Use this when you already have the upstream repo on disk.

```bash
python scripts/sync_docs.py --source-path ../openclaw --mode pinned
python scripts/validate_docs.py
python scripts/build_knowledge.py
python scripts/diff_docs.py
```

### Option 2: Sync from GitHub

Use this when you want to refresh directly from upstream.

```bash
python scripts/sync_docs.py --repo-url https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw --ref main --mode tracking
python scripts/validate_docs.py
python scripts/build_knowledge.py
python scripts/diff_docs.py
```

## What the maintenance scripts do

- `scripts/sync_docs.py`: copies docs and `docs.json` from upstream into this repo and records snapshot metadata
- `scripts/validate_docs.py`: checks that required doc areas exist and `docs.json` does not reference missing pages
- `scripts/build_knowledge.py`: builds `state/docs-manifest.json`, `state/topic-index.json`, and a generated routing cheatsheet
- `scripts/diff_docs.py`: compares the previous and current manifests and writes `state/latest-diff.md`

## Snapshot metadata

The current snapshot state is tracked in committed files under `state/`.

The most important one is `state/source-lock.json`, which records:

- upstream repository URL
- tracked ref
- resolved upstream commit
- sync timestamp
- whether the snapshot came from a local repo or a fresh clone

This makes it possible to answer version-sensitive questions without guessing.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+ is sufficient for the included scripts
- `git` is required for remote sync mode
- `rg` is recommended for fast lookup during interactive use

The maintenance scripts use only the Python standard library.

## Usage notes

- The checked-in snapshot currently targets the English OpenClaw docs set
- Generated files under `state/` should be rebuilt after every sync
- Validation should pass before you claim a refresh succeeded
- This repo is intended for OpenClaw-local reference and maintenance workflows, not for pushing changes back into the upstream OpenClaw docs repo
